# DNS Queries

# All records of a particular type for a given host name

```dig key.zone.target.com TXT```

# Complete Zone Transfer

Need to ask the actual name server of the domain, not a third party name server like 1.1.1.1/8.8.8.8!

```dig @zone.target.com zone.target.com AXFR```

You can also ask a name server for other zones it may be hosting, including internal zone information!

```dig @zone.target.com company.local AXFR```

# Server Specific

## Bind

 Has a special query syntax using the `version.bind` option against the `chaos` domain name, which returns the version of the server.

 ```dig @z.hackycorp.com chaos TXT version.bind```
