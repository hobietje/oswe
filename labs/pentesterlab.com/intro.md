# Command Injection

Remember, there are multiple ways we could inject a second command:

* command1 && command2 that will run command2 if command1 succeeds.
* command1 || command2 that will run command2 if command1 fails.
* command1 ; command2 that will run command1 then command2.
* command1 | command2 that will run command1 and send the output of command1 to command2.
