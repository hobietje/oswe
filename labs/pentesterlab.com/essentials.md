# Authentication Flaws

Change username in cookies... duh!

Decode values in cookies... e.g. this is MD5 of username.

Are username comparisons done the same on the FE, BE, and DB layers?  
* Can we register a new user with a "different" name, e.g. "admin" vs "ADMIN"?
* Can we rely on whitespace being handled differently or being trimmed, e.g. "admin" vs "admin "?

Is data leaked in the response body of redirects to the login page, due to the HTTP response not being terminated correctly?
